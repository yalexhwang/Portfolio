			<span class="defaultMessage">I also use <span class="focus">Bootstrap</span> often, to a varying degree. Just to take advantage of its default CSS settings and compoments, so I can avoid having to look at HTML elements that are so basic. Or go all out and make use of its custom jQuery plugins to have some live action going on. Although Bootstrap's reponsive utilities are useful, once I learned about Flexbox, CSS3's new layout mode, it has become my go-to method of creating a fully responsive layout.</span>

			<span class="defaultMessage">I am a fan of <span class="focus">AngularJS</span>. When I first learned to use Angular, the difference was so drastic that it felt like when you go from the Stone Age to the Iron Age in Age of Empires 2(!) I have built a few single page web applications with Angular, including this portfolio. One thing with Angular that I did not quite like was that it is not an ideal match with Bootstrap, which uses jQuery plugins. But there is a nice alternative, Angular UI. It includes UI Bootsrap as well as UI Router, which comes handy when you want to have more than one view and even nest them as you wish.</span>

			<span class="defaultMessage"><span class="focus">Node.js</span> is awesome just by the fact that it enables server-side JavaScript. Because Node.js is one of the reasons why I was able to become a full-stack web developer -- that it lowered a barrier to back-end development -- I have a sense of appreciation for Node. I am digging deep into it to truly appreciate and fully explore what it has to offer.</span>
