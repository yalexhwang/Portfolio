		Of course the basics, I know my way around 
		<span ng-class="{'focus': html}">HTML</span>, <span ng-class="{'focus': css}">CSS</span>, and <span ng-class="{'focus': js}">JavaScript</span>.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p2arr.on">
		When working with CSS, I prefer to use SASS based <span  ng-class="{'focus': compass}">Compass</span> because it is easier to organize and maintin stylesheets with all the perks <span ng-class="{'focus': sass}">SASS</span> brings, like nesting, variables, mixins and selector inheritence. It saves me time (and headache). 
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p3arr.on">
		I also use <span ng-class="{'focus': bootstrap}">Bootstrap</span> all the time, to a varying degree. Just to take advantage of its default CSS settings and compoments, so I can avoid having to look at HTML elements that are so basic. Or go all out and make use of its custom jQuery plugins to have some live action going on.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p3arr.on">
		Although Bootstrap's reponsive utilities are useful, once I learned about <span ng-class="{'focus': flex}"">Flexbox</span>, CSS3's new layout mode, it has become my go-to method of creating a fully responsive layout.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p4arr.on">
		I am a fan of <span ng-class="{'focus': angular}">AngularJS</span>. When I first learned to use Angular, the difference was so drastic that it felt like when you go from the Stone Age to the Iron Age in Age of Empires 2(!) I have built a few single page web applications with Angular, including this portfolio. One thing with Angular that I did not quite like was that it is not an ideal match with Bootstrap, which uses jQuery plugins. But there is a nice alternative, <span class="etc">Angular UI</span>. It includes <span class="etc">UI Bootsrap</span> as well as <span class="etc">UI Router</span>, which comes handy when you want to have more than one view and even nest them as you wish. 
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p5arr.on">
		<span ng-class="{'focus': python}">Python</span>, who doesn't love Python? I like how simple its syntax is. Makes code aesthetically more pleasing to my eyes. I don't have to worry about balancing braces, although I have to be careful with indentation. Along with <span ng-class="{'focus': flask}">Flask</span>, it is so simple to get basic set up started to build an web applicaiton. <span class="etc">virtualenv</span> is useful, it helps to manage separate environtments for different Python projects.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p6arr.on">
		<span ng-class="{'focus': node}">Node.js</span> is awesome just by the fact that it enables server-side JavaScript. Because Node.js is one of the reasons why I was able to become a full-stack web developer -- that it lowered a barrier to back-end development -- I have a sense of appreciation for Node. I am digging deep into it to truly appreciate and fully explore what it has to offer. 
		<p ng-show="p7arr.on">
		Like Flask with Python, <span ng-class="{'focus': express}">Express</span> and Node.js is a lovely pair. Express Generator sets you a skeleton for an web application in seconds.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p8arr.on">
		I like using <span ng-class="{'focus': mongo}">MongoDB</span>, simply because it is straightfoward to handle JSON based data with JavaScript. However, I have chosen to use <span ng-class="{'focus': sql}">MySQL</span> when data in use is relational by nature -- useful information can be drawn based on how different pieces of data relates to each other. 
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p9arr.on">
		Of course I use <span ng-class="{'focus': git}">Git</span>. It took me a while to understand the basic operations (all those times with a merge conflict...) Now I see how beneficial it is, especially thinking about all the trouble I had with document control in my previous career.
		</p>
		<p ng-show="p10arr.on">
		I am also familar with <span ng-class="{'focus': agile}">Agile scrum methodology</span> thanks to the group projects I did at DigitalCrafts. I come from <span ng-class="{'focus': pm}">project management</span> background, so I understand the general concepts and approaches.
