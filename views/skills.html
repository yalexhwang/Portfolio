	<p>
	These go without saying. I know my way around 
	<span class="skill lng">HTML</span>
	<span class="skill lng">CSS</span> and 
	<span class="skill lng">JavaScript</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
	<span class="skill ext">SASS/Compass</span>
	When working with CSS, I usually use Compass (SASS based) because it allows nesting, variables, mixins and selector inheritence. It is easier to organize and maintin stylesheets. It saves me time (and headache). 
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="skill frm">Bootstrap</span>
	I also like using Bootstrap to take advantage of its default CSS settings and compoments. HTML elements, such as input, form, button, and table, are just prettier with Bootstrap. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Although Bootstrap's reponsive utilities are useful, once I learned about <span class="skill misc">Flexbox</span>, CSS3's new layout mode, it has replaced Bootstrap's 'col-*-'s as my go-to method of creating a fully responsive layout.
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="skill frm">AngularJS</span>
	<span class="skill ext">UI Bootstrap</span>
	I love Angular. When I first learned to use Angular, it was such a drastic change, it almost felt like when you go from the Stone Age to the Iron Age in Age of Empires 2. I have built a few single page applications with Angular (including this portfolio). One thing with Angular that I did not quite like was that it is not an ideal match with Bootstrap, (because its 'live' actions are based on jQuery plugins), but there is a decent alternative, <span class="skill misc">UI Bootstrap</span>. UI Router is awesome too, for allowing me to have more than one view and even nest them as I wish.

	<p>
	<span class="skill lng">Python</span>
	<span class="skill frm">Flask</span>
	Python, who doesn't love Python? I like how simple the syntax is. It looks clean, makes code aesthetically more pleasing to my eyes. I don't have to worry about balancing braces, as long as I keep indentation properly.
	With Flask, it is so simple to get the basic set up started to build an web applicaiton. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="skill frm">ExpressJS</span>
	<span class="skill frm">NodeJS</span> 
	Express with Node is a great way to start writing an web application.

	Vanilla JS
