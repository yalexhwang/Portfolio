				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Nested ngRepeat</span> A quiz is generated using ngRepeat on <code>$scope.quizList</code>, an array of objects, each of which represents a quiz question. Because a quiz question comes with multiple answer options, the object has a property <code>answerOptions</code>, which in turn is an array of objects. So, a ngRepeat directive is used to iterate over the array <code>$scope.quizList</code> to populate questions. Then, another ngRepeat, nested inside of the first ngRepeat, loops through the array of answer options that belongs to the quiz question object, populating answer options for the question. Because of rather complicated data structure, it was tricky to place the directives properly within DOM elements while keeping track of <code>$index</code> from both arrays.
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Consecutive AJAX Requests on Array</span> Each word in the database is tracked with quiz records, whether a student answered the word in question correctly or not. A service method <code>WordBankService.updateWordRecord</code> returns a deferred promise, which is resolved or rejected depending on return value of an AJAX call it makes. Because several words need to be updated at once, they are passed to the service as an array, prompting the service to make consecutive AJAX calls. <code>$q.all</code> was used to make sure all requests are returned before calling the callback function.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Opening a Port</span> When the application was deployed to my server initially, no data was being returned from the database. The application was listenting to port 3000, the default value set by Express generator. It turned out that port 3000 was already in use by another application on my server. I opened another port and allowed inbound traffic to it on AWS.</p>

I wanted to restructure it to have an API and have Admin Portal to interact with the database using the API, in attempt to increase scalability and to have an option of having some data open to public in the future.<br/>
				In Admin Portal, you can access current data including users, NFC devices, events, and containers. You can register a new user, add a new event, or edit/delete an existing user or event.

				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">CRUD Principle</span> How the basic four operations, Create, Read, Update and Delete correspond to the HTTP methods, such as GET and POST. <br/></p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Endpoint Design: Nouns and Verbs </span> Instead of using verbs in endpoints, I learned that it is desirable to use nouns to represent resources and have the HTTP method as what to do (verbs), for more flexibility and better organization. It seems that the way endpoints are designed are closely intertwined with the way data is structured. It was interesting to me as it means you want to work with the entire data as a system and an API as a set of patterns to navigate the system. Although my API was simple, I very much enjoyed reading about APIs and building one on my own. I would like to keep learning about API design. <br/></p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">UI Router</span> Instead of using ngRoute module of Angular.js, I used UI Router to create a more dynamic single page application that has nested views. As I was learning how to work with <code>$stateProvider</code> of UI Router, I could see the differences between UI Router and Angular router, and when UI Router will be more appropriate to use. <br/></p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Image Upload</span> There are many ways to save an image, but I wanted to try encoding the image and save it as a blob directly into the database, using HTML5's File Reader object. I could quickly see why it was not a common practice to save it in a database because the size of the blob for a rather small image (less than 2MB) was too large to be easily handled in a browser. <br/></p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Using Relational Database</span> I decided to use MySQL because the data to be used were mainly about users and their NFC devices. All other data were additional information about users and devices, meaning they are relational in nature. I created 14 tables, one of which was for users, with 5 other 'children' tables such as employment record, place of birth, parents' full name, whose table name starts with a underscore ('_') to indicate its relationship to the 'parent' users table. However, with the data spread out in several tables, writing queries was not as straightforward.</p>

					<p><span class="subtitle">Authentication Cookies</span>As a user, sign in/out status used to feel as if it was a distinct state, like on and off. While implementing it, I realized it was rather a set of actions that is initiated by one time verification of username and password, followed by creation of a token, which is used for repeated verifications on every page access (or route change, to be precise). Use of cookies is essential in the process, for it allows a token to be stored and be accessible throughout the website. Although it was technically simple implementation, it was intriguing to experience a change in the concept of sign in/out - a perspective shift from a user's to a developer's side.</p>

I used ng-show/ng-hide to display or hide menu items depending on sign in/out status. The problem was that they were evaluated only once at the initial page load. To solve the problem, I added a run block <code>.run()</code> with <code>$rootScope.$on</code>. A global variable <code>$rootScope.loggedIn</code> was used to indicate sign in/out status and <code>$locationChangeStart</code> to monitor route change.</p>

				<h3>Notes</h3>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Foreign Language Characters</span> When I was working locally, Korean characters were broken, looking like a gibberish. When I served it up on Node.js, they started to display correctly. Researching why, I learned that there were different types of encoding, depending on the language's character sets. I understand why UTF-8, not ASCII, is now widely used. Node.js natively supports UTF-8 encoding, which was why Korean characters were displayed correctly once served up by Node.js. I also added <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> to make sure web browsers correctly encode my scripts.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p><span class="subtitle">Logic for generating quiz problems and answer options</span> It was more complicated than I initially thought to write a program that randomly selects a word and pairs it with the answer options, only one of which is the correct answer, and track each one of them. It was when I did not know how to use a database; I simply had a <code>.json</code> file that contained vocabulary as an object. I ended up using multiple arrays to temporarily store different groups of words (e.g., problems, correct answer options, incorrect answer options). I am planning to connect to a database with a schema, which will help simplify the process of generating quiz questions.</p>
